# Demographic Data Analyzer
## Data Analysis with Python
### Description:
This is the second project of a series of five, of the Data Analysis with Python course of FreeCodeCamp.
In this particular case, I put into practice the use of Pandas, conditional filtering and indexing, CSV reading and transformation to DF, among others.
### Usage: 
Fork the repository, and just run the .ipynb file which will read the .csv file to see the output.
